    <h1>Creating a fruit bowl in <em>Blender</em></h1>
    <h2>The Planning</h2>
    <p>For my bowl I wanted to select a theme or a general concept and build the components around that idea.
        I chose to represent the concept of Sour and Harsh. I tried out different layouts and styles, but in the end I decided I wanted it to have a muddy and messy look as if it was made from clay dripping.</p>

    <h2>Building the <em>Bowl</em></h2>
    <p>To create my bowl I used an Open-Source Software called <em>Blender</em>. First, I created a circle plane and extruded its vertices to create the base structure of my 3D model. After this, I started experimenting and modelling the bowl in the <em>Sculpt Mode</em>. Once I was satisfied with my bowl I created and sculpted the fruit with the same process, starting from 3D objects like spheres and cylinders.</p>
    
    <p>At this point, I placed three different light sources around the fruit bowl, to recreate a "sour" mood. All three lights have a different color to enhance the contrasts and shadows on the objects.</p>

    <p>In the end, I created an animation that showed the bowl rotating on a plane and exported it as Mp4.</p>
    <p>Below you can see the final animated result.</p>
